summary: "Jump-tech has crafted a sophisticated mobile application, MyCZU, designed to operate seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms, with robust support for LCP (Learning Content Package). This innovative solution caters to the needs of university students by providing access to a wide array of PDF and EPUB3 ebooks, as well as other educational materials. The application offers users (primarily students) the flexibility to lend, buy, or in certain instances, read these materials for free. However, the protection of authors' rights remains a paramount priority for the university."
