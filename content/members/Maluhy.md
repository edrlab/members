summary: "Maluhy&Co., established in 2004 by two physicists, has revolutionized the Brazilian publishing industry with its scientific approach to content conversion and processing technologies. Driven by a commitment to Research, Development, and Innovation, the company has mastered multi-format platforms creation—including LaTeX, ePub2 and 3, Daisy, XML, HTML, and the groundbreaking braille-ink technology. As the trusted partner to over 850 clients in Brazil, including the Federal Government's primary producer of digital and braille books, Maluhy&Co. has established itself as the foremost leader in editorial technology solutions. The company's dedication to excellence earned international recognition with the 2019 ABC International Excellence Award for Accessible Publishing (WIPO/UN), highlighting its pioneering "multi languages" project—the first retail book conceived in universal design that seamlessly integrates sign language, audio, braille, and printed text into a single, comprehensive product."
