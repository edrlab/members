summary: "A GenAI startup. Develops a content creation platform, multilingual and multimodal; addresses the book publishing segment. Develops an ebook reader with Readium Mobile and Web. The conversational robot Chai reader, is like a virtual bookseller. The application can answer readers' questions about a particular title. The idea is not to broadcast the content of the book, but to answer the question as if someone had read it. The tool, allows you to buy the book via a link to an online marketplace. The company is paid by subscription for this BtoC service, with the publisher paying nothing by securely supplying its titles."
